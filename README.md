# Knife Tracker App

**Knife Tracker App** is a mobile application built with **Expo + React Native + Expo Router** designed to track CS2 knife listings in real time.

The app allows users to:

- View real-time knife listings  
- Filter by knife type  
- See price, float value, and image  
- Receive notifications when new knives appear  
- Sync with a FastAPI backend that performs scraping and background monitoring  

The project runs on both iOS and Android (with a Dev Client for notifications).
